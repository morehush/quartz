Falk researches the 5 books from the Inn, with aid and guidance from Fex

Research findings:
- NOMEN tribe of centaurs that have been in area for 10k years
- tasked with guarding the valley of the dead
- valley of the dead is roughly where the footsteps end (people of varnhold)
- NOMEN tribe over generations lost what their purpose was, still guard but don't understand why
- Were told an unspeakable evil would eventually arise and plague the land
- Before the NOMEN tribe came, the entire area was a great Cyclopian civilization that rivaled Thessalonian Empire
- this valley was home to Vordekai, who was a cyclopian necromancer
- Vordekai's cursed tomb is in the mountains
- NOMEN tribes are matriarchal in nature
- couple 100 years back, there was a big battle and most males were slaughtered
- Males are now mostly hunter-gatherers

On the way to giant Fossil Ribcage, we come across a cave. Recognize several items that we have seen on the spriggans. Looks like they left them intentionally. Appears it was a spriggan hovel until they heard centaurs were in Varnhold and they left. 

# Fossil ribcage

A cyclops could walk underneath without their heads touching. Ribcage spans acres. As we approach, there is a large heard of mastodons. Approximately 40 mastodon.

Investigate ribcage, nesting grounds for dozens of families of fungi. Find alters, one at tip of nose of skull with offerings of rancid meat and wineskins full of wine.

Fex speaks with animals on matriarch mastodon. Finds out the centaurs leave the offerings every couple of days and come from and return to the east. Fex casts a spell to make foliage grow like crazy to feed the mastodons well and we head east.

# Heading East

Fex sees a large cloud of dust, appears to be heading in our direction. 2000 feet away.

Lead NOMEN centaur tells us they kill Varnhold villagers on sight. The Villagers began slaughtering the NOMEN tribeswomen. They have encountered Kolcheck tribe spriggans as well. We show the Skybolt bow, they say it was lost by their war priestess years ago. They appreciate that one of us speaks Sylvan.

We are escorted to their encampment. Encampment dominates a large hillock amongst a sea of grass. Open-sided hide huts. A score of centaurs doing a rhythmic dance around a large bonfire. We wait for the dance to end to speak to the war priestess. An older stern-looking centaur observes the dance. Falk deduces that she is the war priestess.

When the dance ends, the centaur woman who guided us into the village leads us to the war priestess. Her name is Akora, she thanks us for waiting for their mother-moon ritual to finish. We present the bow to her. She says it has been missing for many moons.

We describe what we learned in Varnhold of the people. Their scout in the sacred valley saw movement, but nothing else. She forbid the scout from investigating further. That scout has been missing for a while. The scout, Zamamthe was her daughter, last seen days ago.

We ask Skora if it would be permissible to investigate in the Valley of the Dead. Skora says that if we find information about her daughter or return her daughter to her, there could be an accord. Skora permits us to stay the night.

# Heading to Torres of Levenies

While camping, Root sees a shadowy figure skulking about. It approaches Root stealthily, he casts moonlight ray. The object hisses horribly and wakes the rest of the party. Root defeats the Fiend before the rest of the party fully awakes.
