# Fort Drevlin

We attempt to enter the town to gather intelligence but Lord Drevlin has put the town on lockdown. They are at war. The guards are really looking to get fucking mulletted, so they want booze. We show them a barrel of some wine or something we take out of the chest of holding. They tell us we can enter, but we'd have to give a sample to Lord Drevlin to taste test it. The guards let us in. Sir Roger is the guardsman that lets us enter the town.

We walk by a small stone shrine of Hanspur, the god of rivers and river travel. It is also empty and the weeds have been overgrown for a few weeks now. There's an abandoned church of Handspur. The Velvet Corner is the location of Satander More that Cassandra told us to talk to. From a large building there is a large amount of smoke coming from a chimney, stable and smithee. The large temple has a large stag in the center. Temple of Aristel, went up hastily. Nothing is coming or going from the temple and the grounds are unkempt. Roots takes a look inside the temple. It is completely empty and incomplete. 

There are no horses in the stables and smithee. There are no horses in the town that we have seen. Roots remembers that Cassandra said the barbarian tribe of tiger lords came to make an alliance and because barbarians ride horses, it's possible all the horses got sent to the barbarians. 

Falk checks out the smithee, he is making a longsword. There is a pile of black armor, presumably for the guards. There is another empty temple in town. We go to checkout the Inn. The innkeeper is named Quinn. We get 3 rooms and some ale and such. The innkeeper tells us of the recent visitors. Pytaxians, tiger lords, etc. The tiger lord's sister is married to Lord Drevlin. Her name is Pavati Strewn Drevlin. Since then about half of the citizens have left the city. There is a curfew. If you get caught outside at night the hill giants drag you off. The barbarians and hill giants are kind of at a stalemate. The reason for the curfew is that the baron is afraid of revolt. 

# Back to Ken at The Velvet Corner

The Velvet Corner has an awful lot of town guards and scantilly clad women. Ken sees in one alcove a pennant with cross whips and a kneeling pillow. Plush carpets and comfy furniture all over. The women all seem like they are just there to work. The guards seem to be taking liberties. A beautiful woman, dressed better than the others, slinks out of a bedchamber and looks down at Ken and says, "Can I help you, little one." He tells her that Cassandra told him to meet with her. She asks is Cassandra gave him anything to prove the he knew her. Ken is reluctant to reveal the ring to the wonman, not sure that she is Satander More. She takes him to a private room. Ken reveals the ring and she asks if Cassandra is safe. Ken tells Satander that Cassandra is safe in Taztleford. Ken tells Satander what has happened since we left Taztlford. She tells Ken that the town is suffering under Lord Drevlin and needs to be freed from his rule. 

Ken sends for Falk and Roots and they join him at The Velvet Corner. We ask Satander if she has an idea of how we could go about getting rid of Drevlin. She says the Baronness is throwing a birthday party for herself, but only the folk staying at the keep have been invited. The Baron surrendered to Pytax when the emmisaries came. The baron has sequestered himself into his keep and locked it down. The Baronesses brother has disappeared, looking for something, also taking several women from the town as hostages. The baron has sold all of this town to Pytax, for the most part. The only goods coming into the town go straight to the keep. The city folk have to smuggle goods for themselves. She does know of a secret tunnel with an exit at the lake of hooktongue, but she is unsure of where it comes exits outside the keep. We ask her to draw up a map. She does. Also, there seems to be a woman staying at the keep. Shortly arrived after the marriage of the baron and baronness, she was seen in the towers of the keep. Not sure what the connection is. As for the hill giants; they are a small force (about 6) that was brought in from the surrounding area. There is a small encampment of giants to the northwest of the tiger lord territory. The hill giants were a gift from King Izad of Pytax. The tiger lord's barbarians have been in the area to the northwest for thousands of years in the plains. There are rumors that the current lord is an old lord that has been reborn. Like the Dhali Lama. The guard force seem to be more loyal to Pytax than to Lord Drevlin. As for getting citizens to help, that would be a challenge. Lord Tarryn Mossey is still imprisoned underneath the keep. 

# Luring Giants into the Temple to Die

We set up a barricade to the stairs to protect us and Falk readies a wall of fire to put up at the entrance to trap them inside. Ken lures them by launching his returning bolas at one giant to trip him. He falls and goes "oof." The other giants take the bait. Ken runs back into the temple, giants follow. Falk casts wall of fire to trap them inside. **BATTLE**

We kill the 6 giants and string them up around the temple just to let everyone know they're dead. We clean up the barricades in the temple to make it look like we were never there. Then we head for the tunnel.

# The Tunnel

We pretend we are fishermen and take the collapsible boat out in the lake for a little while before making our way to the tunnel. We collapse the boat and enter the tunnel. We encounter 2 black puddings in the first cavernous area we reach. **FIGHT**

We defeat the black puddings and check out the steel grate door at the other end of the cavern. The gate has a lock on it and looks very rusty. Ken attempts to pick the lock, but is not successful. Roots kicks the door open.
