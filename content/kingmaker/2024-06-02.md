# Way Down in the Hole

We drop into a cloud of a sulfur-stinking cloud. We can hear creatures around us, some sound fearful. Fex casts Gust of Wind on the cloud surrounding us and it pushes the stinking cloud toward one end of the cave we are in. We hear retching coming from the cloud. Roots casts fireball in the direction of the retching noises. **FIGHTING**

With the cloud now disappated, we can see we are in a cavern with a ceiling of 15 feet. Lots of cowering bogards in the corners.
