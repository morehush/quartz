# Way Down in the Hole

We drop into a cloud of a sulfur-stinking cloud. We can hear creatures around us, some sound fearful. Fex casts Gust of Wind on the cloud surrounding us and it pushes the stinking cloud toward one end of the cave we are in. We hear retching coming from the cloud. Roots casts fireball in the direction of the retching noises. **FIGHTING**

With the cloud now dissipated, we can see we are in a cavern with a ceiling of 15 feet. Lots of cowering bogards in the corners. 

Bogards are a hierarchal society with a chieften as a leader. Normally are not that terrible as a society. But Falk has a feeling he might have been under the Naga's spell but may not be any more. Falk calls out to the chieftan to surrender. He drops to his knees and surrenders. He feels he was under a cumpulsion to plague the area and unite the tribes. They didn't like that idea. Sopek sent groups out to attack anything that they could confidently take on. Again, Sopek says he feels he was under a spell that compelled him to do these things. He feels his god has forsaken him. 

All of the other bogards that were cowering in the caves stand and yell for us to "Kill the heretic!"

Fex takes the frost mace. Mace Windu. 

Falk tells the party what Sopek has said as well as what the cowering bogards have said. Roots lops off Sopek's head. The cowering bogards rejoice.

We tell the bogards that Garrum will be by to sort them out.

Loot:
- Harp of Charming
- 3x Elixirs of Swimming
- box of 12 Teldaine stamped gold ingots
- 4000 gold pieces
- 50 platinum pieces

We take Sopek's head to Garrum. He gives us:

Loot:
- Figurine of wondrous power
- Ebony fly

We travel to the bogstriders and tell them of Sopek and the influence the Naga had over him and that he is dead. The bogards are under new management. They thank us. But they inform us of several notable locations to explore or ignore, as we deem necessary. There's only a couple of things we haven't explored yet:

- The chuul have been killed
- To the west is a patch of Lilies that humoids seem to have drowned and disappeared in asthe lilies are poten in hallucinogenics. They drown in a euphoric state.
- a nine-headed hydra
- a bog filled with acid-spitting slugs
- a peet bog with undead things
- west from the peet is a troup of fey that ride wargs and like messing with travelers
- north of the swamp scar is a secret glen full of dragonflies of various sizes
- a bog full of quicksand
- multiple tribes of bogards throughout the area, reluctant to join m'batu
- north of the lake is more undead
- southwest corner of the swamp is a bunch of refugees from Ft Drevlin that want to get away from it all
- various other monsters
- legends of Old Hooktongue, dormant for 20 years, active for 3 weeks, dormant another 20 years.

We encounter a bogard war party and Falk tells them that Sopek is dead and they can fuck off or get fucked. They fuck off.

We head for Fort Drevlin. 
# Fort Drevlin

The town of Fort Drevlin is an impressive town, built on top of a bluff overlooking Lake Hooktongue. The walls of the fort are not complete. There is a section that looks like construction stopped. Big gape in the wall on the west side. 15x20 ft gate entrance, maybe steel doors. The walls are wooden ramparts with 6 watch towers. The Drevlin keep is a large stone edifice at the edge of the town overlooking the forest. The guard watch circumnavigates the wall, with archers in the watch towers. The town itself is close to 100-150 buildings. 1 looks like a temple, 1 a barracks. A fair amount of docks on lake Hooktongue.

There are many travelers on the road and travelers get shooed away by guards if they approach the section of wall that is incomplete.

The gates close at night and the patrols double. Ginormous 16 foot tall creatures roam the streets at night. Maybe stone giants? Holding maces made of wood and bone. Maybe some with scythes. Definitely giants of a few to many varieties. People who arrive late have to camp outside the gate. 

Fex sends his raven up. The raven reports back, "Giants all the time. Little people, none. Come from big stone thing." Cassandra Numassi asked us when we got to Fort Drevlin to look up a person named Satinder Morne. She is a "friend" of Cassandra Numassi.
